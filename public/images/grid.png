This is a placeholder. You should create a grid pattern image and save it here as grid.png.

A good grid pattern would be a subtle dot or line pattern with a transparent background that can be tiled.
The color should be very light or white with low opacity so it can be used as a subtle texture.
 
You can create this in any image editing software or find a free pattern online.
